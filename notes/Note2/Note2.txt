something fishy with dispelupgrade
something is fishy with save load builded building
attack rate is displayed as 0
wavenumber overflow at end of game
necro raise icon grayed out
idea: make player unit move only if enemy range advantage
spell shield damage reduction written as 20000 %
should gray out upgraded upgrade at buildings
updrades can be qued with negative money
